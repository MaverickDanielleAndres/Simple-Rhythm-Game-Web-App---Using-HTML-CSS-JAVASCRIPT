# Rhythm Master - Beat Game

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my rhythm game project. This is a simple but fun browser-based game where you test your timing skills by pressing keys when colored beats reach the target zone.

## What's this all about?

I built this game because I wanted to create something that's both entertaining and technically interesting. It combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with audio processing to create an engaging rhythm experience. The game is inspired by classic rhythm games but with a modern web-based approach.

## How to play

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Click "START GAME"
3. Watch for colored beats falling down the lanes
4. Press the corresponding keys (D, F, J, K) when beats reach the blue target zone at the bottom
5. Try to get PERFECT hits for maximum points
6. The game lasts 45 seconds - try to beat your high score!

## Features

- Clean, modern interface with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- Audio feedback for hits and misses using the Web Audio API
- Visual effects when you hit beats (music notes that fly away)
- Score tracking with personal best saved in your browser
- Pause/resume functionality
- Responsive design that works on most devices
- Progress bar showing time remaining

## Technical details

This game is built purely with:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and audio processing
- Web Audio API for sound generation
- localStorage for saving your best score

No external libraries or frameworks were used - just vanilla web technologies.

## Development notes

I focused on creating a smooth gameplay experience with:
- Precise timing detection
- Visual feedback for hits/misses
- Performance optimizations for animation
- Cross-browser compatibility

The game automatically saves your best score using your browser's localStorage, so you can try to beat your personal record each time you play.

## Known limitations

- Audio may not work in all browsers (Web Audio API support varies)
- Game is best played on devices with physical keyboards
- Visual effects may be reduced on lower-end devices

## Future improvements

Ideas I had but didn't implement:
- Different difficulty levels
- Custom song integration
- Multiplayer competition
- Mobile touch controls
- More varied visual themes

## Feedback

If you have any suggestions or find bugs, feel free to reach out! I'd love to hear what you think about the game.

Happy gaming! ðŸŽµ
